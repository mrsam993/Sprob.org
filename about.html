		<h3>Everything about me and my journey</h3>
		
		<div class="about-picture-1">

		</div>
		
		<div class="about-p-1-div">
			<p class="about-p-1">Since the age of 15 I have been working to hone my craft of coding and programming. Through attending extra curricular classes, integrating programming into any aspect of my life I can and most recently, attending university to learn from experts in the field. Programming is my passion and a skill I have been working to improve for most of my life and will always continue to work on.</p>
		</div>
		
		<div class="about-p-1-div">
			<p class="about-p-2">After I attended my first class at my high schools extra curricular programming class, I fell in love with the subject, making sure to attend every session and get a head start even before we were learning how to program in class. When the time finally came around to use programming in an in-class assignment for GCSEâ€™s I managed to secure an A* for my project.</p>
		</div>
		
		<div class="about-p-1-div">
			<p class="about-p-2">Sixth form was the next big step in my learning, there was no programming taught directly in class, but I was so eager to do more that I integrated robotics and programming into my design tech course work. By the end of the year I had a stylish and functional robotic clock that scored me an A overall. I proved that I could do what I loved no matter the circumstance and made an effort to pursue programming even more in every avenue I could.</p>
		</div>
		
		<div class="about-p-1-div">
			<p class="about-p-2">From taking part in multiple GameJams, teaching myself multiple new languages and attending a programming course at Bournemouth university, I have followed through on my desire to take every opportunity to better myself and learn as much as I can about a field I love so much.</p>
		</div>
		
		
		<h3 class="about-h32">What motivates me</h3>
		
		<div class="number-div">
			<p class="number">1.</p>
		</div>
		
		<div class="about-p-2-div">
			<p class="about-p-2">Although these points are in no particular order the factor the drives me the most is my love of the field. From working on algorithms and making them more efficient to teaching myself new languages to make self-taught projects (like this website), after years of practice I adore what I do and consider it as much as a hobby as I would a potential job. </p>
		</div>
		
		<div class="number-div">
			<p class="number">2.</p>
		</div>
		
		<div class="about-p-2-div">
			<p class="about-p-2">One of the things that I love about programming is the goal of making things efficient and constantly working on improvement which is another driving factor for me. The idea that an algorithm can be optimized or knowing that I can go back and improve my previous scripts with new knowledge serves as a constant drive for motivation so I can improve my work and my skills as a whole.</p>
		</div>
		
		<div class="number-div">
			<p class="number">3.</p>
		</div>
		
		<div class="about-p-2-div">
			<p class="about-p-2">My final biggest drive is a desire to learn and deepen my knowledge. Programming is such a big field with so many different languages that can be learnt and I could easily go through my entire career without knowing so much. I find something so exciting about venturing into a totally unknown language and learning about something I would never touch on in my normal path in education.</p>
		</div>
		
		<h3 class="about-h33">Whats next for me...</h3>
		
		<div class="about-picture-2">
			<img src="images/about-future.jpg" width="200" height="200" class="about-pic-1" alt="picture of me">
		</div>
		
		<div class="about-p-3-div">
			<p class="about-p-3">The next big thing for me is my placement year that I will be taking between my 2nd and 3rd year of university, and if you are reading this, there is a good chance that you are an employer who has been directed to this site by me. If that is not the case and you want to get in contact with me for placement or other business inquires you can use the email found on the social page. As far as studies go, I plan on finishing my university course and continuing to take extra steps towards learning such as, participating in GameJams, self-teaching more languages and working on more personal projects to further my knowledge and continue my passion of programming.</p>
